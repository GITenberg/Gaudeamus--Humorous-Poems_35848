<h2><a name="div1_preface" href="#div1Ref_preface">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>
<br>

<p class="normal">This volume contains the greater portion of the poems which constitute
the Gaudeamus--'Let us be jolly'--of Joseph Victor Scheffel, who is at
present the most popular poet in Germany. Without being presented as
such, these ballads, though complete in themselves, form in their
connection a droll history of the world and of humanity--advancing from
the early outburst of Granite and Basalt, through the boulder of Gneiss
to the Ichthyosaurus and Megatherium. Man then appears as a dweller in
the pre-historic Swiss-Lacustrine-dwelling on poles, where he bitterly
bewails the misfortune of being a pioneer of civilization, and as one
born before the invention of modern comforts.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">'In stocks I would gladly grow wealthy,</p>
<p class="t1">But exchange is not yet understood:</p>
<p class="t0">A good glass of beer would be healthy,</p>
<p class="t1">But never a drop has been brewed.'</p>
</div>

<p class="normal">The Early Ph&#339;nician is set forth in a droll song (originally
published under the title of Jonah) which describes the disasters that
befell a guest who could not pay his bill,--presented in arrow-head or
cuneiform characters on six tiles. The old Etruscan era and that of the
ancient German are also painted in a style which, could the truth be
known, would probably be found as genially true to life as it is to the
world-old, infinite spirit of Humour, which moved man in the same
measure in ancient Egypt as in modern England. In these, as in his
serious poems of a more ambitious nature, Joseph Victor Scheffel
manifests a remarkable insight into the inner real life of the past.
Like a geologist, or poet, he infers from trivial relics the probable
feelings and habits of obscure beings or races, or at least imagines
them, and assimilates them to modern usages with rare tact. These
ballads have been printed, sung, and imitated in Germany of late years
to a great extent. Scheffel has in fact founded a school of humorous
poetry--that of the burlesque-scientific and historical--which, though
by no means pretentious, has at least made the world laugh heartily. I
sincerely trust that the following translations will induce the reader
to become familiar with the original.</p>

<p class="normal">I have omitted a few poems from the Gaudeamus, as deficient in the
peculiar spirit of <i>fun</i> which characterises all that are here given;
but should the public manifest its approbation of this work, they may
be found in another edition. In their place I have given translations
of a number of eccentric German-student songs of the new school, nearly
all of which have found their way into the popular German song-books of
late years.</p>

<h2><a name="div1_scheffel" href="#div1Ref_scheffel">JOSEPH VICTOR SCHEFFEL.</a></h2>

<h3>AN INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR.</h3>
<br>

<p class="normal"><i>Joseph Victor Scheffel</i> was born in the year 1826, at Karlsruhe, in
Baden, where his father, a veteran officer, had taken up his residence.
He received his first instruction in the 'Lyceum' of his native place,
a high school which enjoyed at the time a splendid reputation, and was
considered the best in the Grand Duchy of Baden. Whatever may have been
said against one or the other of the professors, the majority were
remarkable men, knowing how to awaken the mental activity of their
pupils. The social life of the 'Lyceists' was free from ordinary
constraints; and the merry youths enjoyed many privileges, which at
other places were strictly reserved for University students.</p>

<p class="normal">Nor did they lack any opportunities for intellectual improvement in the
capital of Baden. The theatre was then excellent, and the 'Lyceists'
visited it regularly. Eyen politics agitated the mind of this young
generation. It must be remembered that thirty years ago Baden was the
focus of political life, to which the eyes of every German patriot was
directed; and although Mannheim was the seat of the agitation, the
chamber united at Karlsruhe a number of men, whose names will ever be
held in respect in Baden: Itzstein, Welcker, Bassermann, Hecker, Mathy,
Soiron.</p>

<p class="normal">Joseph Victor passed with all the honours, and as one of the best
pupils, all the classes of the Lyceum, and then devoted himself to the
study of law at the University of Heidelberg. There he joined a
so-called academical society of progress, without, however, taking part
in the Baden revolution, which drove so many of his comrades into
exile.</p>

<p class="normal">After having passed the Government examination we find our young poet
as '<i>Rechtspractikant</i>' (practitioner of law) in the little town of
Säckingen. Well might the little provincial place appear dull to a
student coming from the liveliest university of Germany. Still the
splendid scenery of the environs of Säckingen compensated for many
shortcomings. With the numerous friends he won there, Scheffel made
frequent excursions through the valleys which stretch in all directions
from the Feldberg and the Rhine. He proved to be a bold and even
reckless swimmer, passing many a time through the bridge of Säckingen,
saluting the bystanders as he accomplished this daring feat.</p>

<p class="normal">In the office of his court, located in an old convent of nuns, Scheffel
found a number of old documents and MSS., and there his first poem was
written, based on one of them: '<i>Der Trompeter von Säckingen. Ein Sang
vom Oberrhein</i>.'</p>

<p class="normal">The success of this first production was complete. It was published at
the time when the 'incense perfume of the pious soul,' as Scheffel
calls the poems of Oskar von Redwitz, had its firmest hold on the
misguided taste of the public. In comparison with this sickly,
effeminate poetry, the simple, natural, and yet intensely poetic
production of Scheffel afforded something like the enjoyment of fresh
mountain air after that of a hot-house. It is true, Scheffel was
at first entirely ignored by the Berlin and Leipzig critics who
assume to sit in judgment over modern German literature (he has,
up to the present day, not even found a place in Brockhaus's
<i>Conversations-Lexicon</i>), but the unsophisticated public recognized the
kernel of pure poetry in Scheffel's unpretentious verses; and his
'Trompeter' is at present the most popular poem in Germany. Its story
is told with extreme simplicity and humour, in blank trochees with
interspersed rhymed poems; it leads us to the forest-town of Säckingen
during the second half of the 17th century, and into the neighbouring
castle of a baron, whose only daughter is wooed and, at last, won by a
young musician, a merry youth, who had been expelled from the
University of Heidelberg on account of his noisy behaviour.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing can be more humorous than the account of the ex-student's life
at Heidelberg, of his duels and his libations beneath the big tun of
the castle,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">Bei dem Wunder unserer Tage,<br>
Bei dem Kunstwerk deutschen Denkens,<br>
Bei dem Heidelberger Fass,</p>
</div>

<p class="continue">or the historical episode of the foundation of Säckingen by Saint
Fridolin, an Irish apostle, sent by Chlodwig with the following message
to convert the Allemannic Germans:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">Hatt' sonst nicht die grösste Vorlieb<br>
Für die Kutten, für die Heil'gen,<br>
Aber seit mir die verfluchten<br>
Scharfen Alemannenspiesse<br>
Allzunah um's Ohr gepfiffen,<br>
Seit der schweren Schlacht bei Zülpich,<br>
Bin ich and'rer Ansicht worden,<br>
--Noth lehrt auch die Könige beten.<br>
Schutz drum geb' ich, wo ihr hinzieht.<br>
Und empfehl' hauptsächlich Euch am<br>
Oberrhein die Alemannen.<br>
Diese haben schwere Schädel,<br>
Diese sind noch trotz'ge Heiden,<br>
Macht mir diese fromm und artig--</p>
</div>

<p class="continue">or the meditations of the cat of the castle, which, as silent witness
of the caresses of the two lovers, thus broods over the enigma of the
kiss:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">Warum küssen sich die Menschen?<br>
S'ist nicht Hass, sie beissen sich nicht,<br>
Hunger nicht, sie fressen sich nicht.<br>
S'kann auch kein zweckloser blinder<br>
Unverstand sein, denn sie sind sonst<br>
Klug und selbstbewusst im Handeln;<br>
Warum, also, frag' umsonst ich,<br>
Warum küssen sich die Menschen?<br>
Warum meistens nur die Jüngern?<br>
Warum diese meist im Frühling?<br>
Ueber diese Punkte werd' ich<br>
Morgen auf des Daches Giebel<br>
Etwas naher meditiren.</p>
</div>

<p class="normal">In the delineations of the various characters of the 'Trompeter'
Scheffel exhibits a gift of true poetical conception, a warmth of
feeling, and a power of description, equalled by few of our modern
poets; indeed, the characters rise before our mind with such
truthfulness, as the idealized types of the people in that corner of
Germany, that one might almost believe one had met all of them during
one's wanderings in the Black Forest, whether it be Werner, the merry
trumpeter, or the crusty old baron, or Anton, the respectable
'Hausknecht.'</p>

<p class="normal">Scheffel did not remain long in Säckingen. He quitted the Government
service, and, after passing some time in travels in South Germany,
settled at Donaueschingen as Keeper of the Archives of Prince
Fürstenberg. This town is likewise exceedingly small, the environs are
bare and not to be compared with the romantic scenery of the Upper
Rhine; but at the court of the refined princes of Fürstenberg there
were at all times remarkable men, and the library afforded, in MSS. and
documents, ample means for the study of Old German history, language,
and literature.</p>

<p class="normal">To this study Scheffel now devoted himself, and, in combining his
qualities as a poet with that of an historian, created his famous novel
Ekkehard. Based chiefly on the Chronicles of the Monastery of St.
Gallen, it gives us a faithful picture of the social life in South
Western Germany--the most ancient seat and nucleus of German
civilization during the tenth century,--in retaining and reproducing
all the naïveté, freshness, and simple-minded views which are the
charms of these celebrated chronicles, whilst the poet's figures are
marked with that distinct individuality which raises the dry chronicle
to a skilful and poetical tale of human passions and conflicts.
Ekkehard may be compared with the best of Sir Walter Scott's novels.
Another fruit of Scheffel's researches in mediæval literature is his
charming little volume '<i>Frau Aventiure</i>,' and likewise, although
published much later, '<i>Juniperus</i>,' the history of a German Crusader,
and his most recent work, '<i>Die Bergpsalmen</i>.' Both these latter works
(the last one is written in verse) exhibit the same merits as Ekkehard,
but they are laid out on a smaller scale, and are of a more fragmentary
character. '<i>Frau Aventiure</i>' is a collection of songs, partly jocose,
partly inspired by the most tender feelings, in the spirit of the poems
of the Minnesinger and wandering scholars of the Middle Ages, and is
based on a subtle knowledge of mediæval culture and poetry.</p>

<p class="normal">But to his second residence in Heidelberg we must trace the origin of
his most popular work, the collection of songs known under the title of
'Gaudeamus.' A small circle of friends, who met every Wednesday evening
at a supper in the Holländer Hof, near the bridge (and amongst whose
most conspicuous members were the celebrated historian Ludwig Haeusser,
and the venerable pastor of Ziegelhausen, Fr. Schmezer), kindled those
sparks of unequalled humour and merriment--the Rodensteiner, 'Im
Schwarzen Wallfisch zu Askalon,' and the geological songs, which
delighted readers of every class, and found their way into every
student's songbook of Germany. The geological songs owe their origin to
a course of lectures on geology which Pastor Schmezer delivered at the
time. Scheffel regularly attended these lectures of his friend, and the
latter was certain to find as regularly on the following morning of his
lecture a poetical resumé of it on his desk, in the form of a humorous
poem.</p>

<p class="normal">What gives such a high value to these songs, and indeed to all the
poetry of Scheffel, is the fact that they, in depicting the joyous vein
in human nature, set forth a faithful abstract, a true poetical
substratum, of the popular life and thought of South-Western Germany.
If any one should fail to comprehend the spirit of Scheffel's poetry
let him go to the 'joyful Palatinate,' and to its ancient capital,
Heidelberg. There he will find the frank, merry, and humorous
characters of Scheffel's poems, and especially the prototypes of that
thirsty soul, the Rodensteiner who pawned his three villages during the
revelries 'Zu Heidelberg im Hirschen,' and finally bequeathed his
thirst to the students. And looking from the ruins of the castle over
the beautiful valleys of the Neckar and the Rhine, he will perhaps
understand the enthusiasm which our poet has for this blessed spot, in
singing:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">Und stechen mich die Dornen,<br>
Und wird mir's draus zu kahl;<br>
Geb' ich dem Pferd die Spornen,<br>
Und reit' in's Neckarthal.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<p class="t3"><i>In unterirdischer Kammer<br>

<p class="t0">In Lot's time there were lots of sulphur,</p>
<p class="t1">And to-day it is piteous on pitch.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">No washwoman comes with a bucket,</p>
<p class="t1">No thirsty man comes with a mug;</p>
<p class="t0">For the one who would venture to suck it</p>
<p class="t1">Would wish that his grave had been dug.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Not a breath of a breeze is blowing,</p>
<p class="t1">No waves on the waters fall,</p>
<p class="t0">Though a strong smell of naphtha is flowing,</p>
<p class="t1">They said, 'We don't mind it at all.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Two dark brown lumps were lying</p>
<p class="t1">Like rocks on the Dead Sea shore,</p>
<p class="t0">And while tenderly loving and sighing</p>
<p class="t1">They sat down there--to rise no more.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">For the rock was pitch-naphtha which would not</p>
<p class="t1">Allow them to stir e'en a stitch,</p>
<p class="t0">And seated in concert, they could not</p>
<p class="t1">Rise up above concert pitch.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then all the disaster comprising,</p>
<p class="t1">They wailed aloud: 'Allah is great!</p>
<p class="t0">We stick and we stick--there's no rising,</p>
<p class="t1">We stick and forever must wait!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">There they sat like a lost pot and kettle,</p>
<p class="t1">Their wails o'er the wilderness passed;</p>
<p class="t0">They mummified little by little,</p>
<p class="t1">And were turned to Asphaltum at last.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">A little bird flew for assistance,</p>
<p class="t1">Away to the townlet of Zoar;</p>
<p class="t0">But benumbed it fell down in the distance,</p>
<p class="t1">It smelt so, it fluttered no more.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">And shuddering and pale as if flurried,</p>
<p class="t1">A pilgrim procession went in--</p>
<p class="t0">From the smell of the benzine it hurried</p>
<p class="t1">So fast you'd not say 't had been seen.</p>
<br>
<h3>MORAL.</h3>
<br>
<p class="t0">In love or in turning a penny</p>
<p class="t1">Always study the field of your luck;</p>
<p class="t0">In petroleum and naphtha full many</p>
<p class="t1">Ere now have been terribly 'stuck.'</p>

<p class="t0">Damp smoky-like vapour is streaming</p>
<p class="t1">O'er piles in the waters below.</p>
<p class="t0">And far o'er the forest are gleaming</p>
<p class="t1">The Alps in perpetual snow.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">A man on a wood block is sitting</p>
<p class="t1">In furs, for the wind-draught is strong:</p>
<p class="t0">With a flint chip a deer-horn splitting,</p>
<p class="t1">While he mournfully murmurs a song:</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'See my face swollen up like the devil!</p>
<p class="t1">Remark how in wind, as it spins,</p>
<p class="t0">The history of Europe primæval</p>
<p class="t1">With rheumatics and toothache begins!</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'It is true that with stone-axe employment,</p>
<p class="t1">Or with celts I can hammer my way,</p>
<p class="t0">But no rational means of enjoyment</p>
<p class="t1">Is known to the world in this day.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Wild animals, wolfish or beary,</p>
<p class="t1">Howl fierce round my forest-tree brown;</p>
<p class="t0">And when I build huts on the prairie</p>
<p class="t1">The buffaloes batter them down.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And so, to the beaver a debtor,</p>
<p class="t1">I build for myself in the flood;</p>
<p class="t0">The further from firm land the better,</p>
<p class="t1">A pile-dam in shingle and mud.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'But much I am forced to dispense with</p>
<p class="t1">What ages to come will behold;</p>
<p class="t0">I'd be glad of a good sword to fence with,</p>
<p class="t1">But as yet there's no iron or gold.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'In stocks I would gladly grow wealthy,</p>
<p class="t1">But exchange is not yet understood:</p>
<p class="t0">A good glass of beer would be healthy;</p>
<p class="t1">But never a drop has been brewed.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And then how my horror increases</p>
<p class="t1">To think of our cookery rude!</p>
<p class="t0">How we crack a pig's bones into pieces,</p>
<p class="t1">And suck out the marrow for food.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And how can the soul be expected</p>
<p class="t1">To form an ideal of taste,</p>
<p class="t0">When nothing but poles are erected</p>
<p class="t1">Around in a watery waste?'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">He sang With a voice hoarse and failing,</p>
<p class="t1">With rheumatics his temper was grim;</p>
<p class="t0">Two wild bears slipped over the poling,</p>
<p class="t1">And, climbing, came snapping at him.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Down he threw, as with anger he flushes,</p>
<p class="t1">Axe, deer-horn, and drink-cup of clay,</p>
<p class="t0">Sprang, splash! like a frog to the rushes,</p>
<p class="t1">And paddled with curses away.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Where once the Lacustrians plying,</p>
<p class="t1">Drove many a pillar or stake,</p>
<p class="t0">A strata of relics is lying</p>
<p class="t1">'Neath the mud and the turf of the lake.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">And he who this song made for singing,</p>
<p class="t1">Himself through those layers has mined,</p>
<p class="t0">And the relics to daylight upbringing,</p>
<p class="t1">Felt pride as a mortal refined.</p>

<p class="t0">Light gleamed upon Helicon's mountain</p>
<p class="t1">In the purple of mid-day and blue,</p>
<p class="t0">As by Aganippe's clear fountain</p>
<p class="t1">A shepherd boy slept in the dew.</p>
<p class="t0">In seeking the lambs of his master,</p>
<p class="t1">From Askra, he'd roamed through the wood,</p>
<p class="t0">But now all the strength of the pastor</p>
<p class="t1">By the heat of the sun was subdued.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then from sun-lighted fields of old story,</p>
<p class="t1">Came Nine who were heavenly fair;</p>
<p class="t0">Their limbs were of beauty a glory,</p>
<p class="t1">And a glory of gold was their hair.</p>
<p class="t0">They moved as in musical numbers,</p>
<p class="t1">To the grove, Aganippe across,</p>

<p class="t1">Their gifts in the emerald moss.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The first a bronze style like a feather,</p>
<p class="t1">The second an inkstand of brass,</p>
<p class="t0">The third a neat album in leather,</p>
<p class="t1">The fourth a Bohemian glass,</p>
<p class="t0">The fifth gave red wax and a taper,</p>
<p class="t1">The sixth a gold eye-glass and sheath,</p>
<p class="t0">The seventh cigars wrapped in paper,</p>
<p class="t1">The eighth a sweet asphodel wreath.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The ninth bent her knee in the heather,</p>
<p class="t1">And kissed him full tender and true,</p>
<p class="t0">Then vanished on high in the æther</p>
<p class="t1">As angels invariably do.</p>
<p class="t0">Up sprung the young dreamer and panted</p>
<p class="t1">And sang in a measure sublime,</p>
<p class="t0">And swung, like a creature enchanted,</p>
<p class="t1">A twig of wild laurel in time.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then up came his friends 'mong the peasants</p>
<p class="t1">And praised his good fortune that day,</p>
<p class="t0">And led him with all his fine presents</p>
<p class="t1">To Askra in festive array:</p>
<p class="t0">And there all the wisest or rudest,</p>
<p class="t1">Considered the matter in doubt,</p>
<p class="t0">Until the Nomarchos as shrewdest</p>
<p class="t1">To Böotia this sentence gave out.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'To him heaven opens a portal,</p>
<p class="t1">No more at the flocks let him look.</p>
<p class="t0">He is destined to be an immortal,</p>
<p class="t1">Write poems--and publish a book.'</p>
<p class="t0">They found him a rod neat and slender,</p>
<p class="t1">In long garments they gave him to God;</p>
<p class="t0">Then he wrote them the Farmer's Calénder,</p>
<p class="t1">And Theogony too--Hesiod.</p>

Mit leisem Frösteln durch das Land Hetruria</i>.</p>
<br>
<p class="continue"><i>Anpumpen, to pump, is a German slang term for borrowing. Pumpus was
the name of an Etruscan prince</i>.</p>
<br>

<p class="t0">Dim was the sunlight, and November shivering<br>
Ran with a light frost o'er the land Etruria,<br>
A gentle head-ache of the last night's origin,<br>
Went threading through the air with weary pinion-beat;<br>
A weak and bankrupt feeling lay on hill and dale,<br>
The sacred olive tree, whose last thin yellow leaf<br>
Thrilled in the wind, stretched mournfully its branches forth<br>
Barren and bare, as wanting what was needfullest;<br>
E'en the street pavement was suspicious. To the eye<br>
The old primæval basalt's firm material<br>
Seemed changed that day to very porous carbonate,<br>
And all things--all things--all things had a seedy look.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Such was the day when, in the early morning hour,<br>
A weary wight from Populonia's portal went;<br>
In vain the guard on the Cyclopean city wall<br>
Cast on the lord a hopeful glance for drink-money,--<br>
He drew him back--and glared at him--and gave nothing.<br>
There where the road goes winding towards Suessulæ,<br>
And some old priest's strange ten-pin-towered monument<br>
Mournfully casts a shadow o'er the bleaching field,<br>
He paused awhile--in the reed grass stuck his javelin,<br>
And in his chlamys foldings sadly sought awhile,<br>
Then sought again--then made one more experiment--<br>
Yet found not what he sought for.</p>
<br>
<p class="right" style="margin-bottom:0px">Oh, who knows the pain</p>
<p class="t0">Which rears up horse-like in a brave Etruscan heart<br>
When all things--all things--all things tend to poverty,<br>
And the horror of the Empty in the pocket dwells<br>
Where once the sesterce gaily by the denar rang!</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The helm removing from his heavy-laden head,<br>
He raised his right hand to his forehead thoughtfully,<br>
His tearful glance went back to Populonia,<br>
And lurid lightning flickered from his hero-eye.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Oh thou Chimæra Tavern!' said he mournfully,<br>
'Was that the end of 't? Meant that the flock of birds<br>
Which three days past went croaking to the left hand side?<br>
Said that the oxen's, entrails enigmatical?<br>
Oh thou Chimæra Tavern, what is pleasanter<br>
Than entering as a guest into thy guest-chamber?<br>
There neatly waits the experienced tavern-keeper;<br>
And heroes round the cool wine are convivial;<br>
Around the noble hill-descended Dimeros.<br>
From drinking mouths comes wisdom flowing thoughtfully,<br>
While at the upper linen-covered long table,<br>
Where Tegulinum's augur to the latest hour,<br>
Sternly defying, stands it like a bronze column,<br>
And sings in glees; that wonderful astrologer;--<br>
Oh thou Chimæra Tavern, tell--if possible--<br>
Whither goes hurrying?--ha! what was't I nearly spoke?--<br>
What word--thrice god-curst word--on which--oh horrible!<br>
Hangs the Etruscan fate--ay, that's it--Ready Money!<br>
Oh Fufluns! Fufluns! Bacchus--dark and terrible!<br>
Now all is gone--away and gone away--ha--hummm!<br>
And yet a deed, I swear 't shall now by me be done,<br>
Such as the stupid world in dream has never dreamed,<br>
Shuddering and cold--my name shall to posterity<br>
By this one deed be carried, awful, horrible,<br>
As true as I by this priest's grave am standing now,<br>
I--Pumpus of Perusia, the Etruscan prince.'<br>
He said--and went. A sunbeam fell uncannily<br>
On spear and helm. Cold light was o'er the cypresses,<br>
Deep the gale sighed--grave-deep--like moaning far-away.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The world was innocent then. As yet no one had known<br>
The law of contracts with its windings intricate,<br>
And e'en the sage in silver beard was ignorant<br>
Of loans or such a deed as money borrowing;<br>
Yet on that day i' the forest by Suessulæ<br>
One hero by another bold was borrowed from!<br>
This is the song of Pumpus of Perusia.</p>

<p class="t0">But in the Teutoburgian forest<br>
How the north wind blew and chor-rused;<br>
Ravens flying through the air,<br>
And there was a perfume there<br>
As of blood and corpses.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">All at once, in sock and buskins<br>
Out came rushing the Cheruskins<br>
Howling, 'Gott und Vaterland!'<br>
They went in with sword in hand,<br>
Against the Roman legions.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Ah, it was an awful slaughter,<br>
And the cohorts ran like water;<br>
But of all the foe that day,<br>
The horsemen only got away,<br>
Because they were on horseback.</p>

<p class="t0">O Quinctilius! wretched general,<br>
Knowest thou not that such our men are all?<br>
In a swamp he fell--how shocking!<br>
Lost two boots, a left-hand stocking.<br>
And, besides, was smothered.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then, with his temper growing wusser.<br>
Said to Centurion Titiusser,<br>
'Pull your sword out--never mind,<br>
And bore me through with it behind,<br>
Since the game is busted.'</p>

As a youth of tender years,<br>
Served among the volunteers,--<br>
He was also captured.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">E'en his hoped-for death was baffled,<br>
For ere they got him to the scaffold<br>
He was stabbed quite unaware,<br>
And nailed fast en derrière<br>
To his Corpus Juris.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">When this forest fight was over<br>
Hermann rubbed his hands in clover;<br>
And to do the thing up right,<br>
The Cheruscans did invite<br>
To a first-rate breakfast.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">But in Rome the wretched varmints<br>
Went to purchase morning garments;<br>
Just as they had tapped a puncheon,<br>
And Augustus sat at luncheon,<br>
Came the mournful story.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">And the tidings so provoked him,<br>
That a peacock leg half choked him,<br>
And he cried--beyond control--<br>
'Varus--Varus--d--n your soul!<br>
Redde legiones!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">His German slave, Hans Schmidt be-christened,<br>
Who in the corner stood and listened,<br>
Remarked, 'Der teufel take me wenn<br>
He efer kits dose droops acain,<br>
For tead men ish not lifin.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Now, in honour of the story,<br>
A monument they'll raise for glory.<br>
As for pedestal--they've done it;<br>
But who'll pay for a statue on it<br>
Heaven alone can tell us.</p>

<p class="t0">A Roman stood in midnight lost,</p>
<p class="t1">For the German line selected;</p>
<p class="t0">Far from the castle was his post,</p>
<p class="t1">His glances east directed.</p>
<p class="t0">He heard a murmur and a fuss,</p>
<p class="t1">And distant voices ringing--</p>
<p class="t0">No pæan of Horatius;</p>
<p class="t1">Right savage was the singing:</p>
<p class="t0">'Ha--haw--haw! we got ye safe at last,</p>
<p class="t0">Got ye by the skirt, too--got ye firm and fast,</p>
<p class="t0">You scamp, you!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">With a maiden of the Chatten race</p>
<p class="t1">He oft in love had meddled,</p>
<p class="t0">And sought her in a lonely place,</p>
<p class="t1">Disguised as one who peddled.</p>
<p class="t0">Now came the vengeance--one, two, three!</p>
<p class="t1">Now o'er the wall they're climbing,</p>
<p class="t0">Screeching like cats in agony,</p>
<p class="t1">With hatchet rattle chiming.</p>
<p class="t0">'Ha--haw--haw! we got you safe at last,</p>
<p class="t0">Got you by the skirt, too--got you firm and fast,</p>
<p class="t0">You scamp, you!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">He drew his sword, he blew his horn,</p>
<p class="t1">And like a warrior shook him;</p>
<p class="t0">But vain were pluck and Roman scorn--</p>
<p class="t1">The savage Deutschers took him.</p>
<p class="t0">They tied him fast, and in a word</p>
<p class="t1">Away with him went bounding,</p>
<p class="t0">And when the cohort came, it heard</p>
<p class="t1">Far through the pine-trees sounding:</p>
<p class="t0">'Ha--haw--haw I we've got him safe at last,</p>
<p class="t0">Got him by the skirt, too--got him firm and fast,</p>
<p class="t0">You scamp, you!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">In the holy grove, toward the east,</p>
<p class="t1">Were all the Chatten foemen,</p>
<p class="t0">To celebrate the Odin feast</p>
<p class="t1">Of Jul, with blood of Roman.</p>
<p class="t0">He felt himself like roasted meat</p>
<p class="t1">'Twixt savage grinders going;</p>
<p class="t0">Out sprang his blonde-haired darling sweet,</p>
<p class="t1">And cried with tears hot flowing:</p>
<p class="t0">Ha--haw--haw! I've got you safe at last,</p>
<p class="t0">Got you by the skirt, too--got you firm and fast,</p>
<p class="t0">You scamp, you!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then all the Chats were deeply moved</p>
<p class="t1">To see her thus accost him,</p>
<p class="t0">And said, 'Since they so well have loved,</p>
<p class="t1">'Twould be a shame to roast him,</p>
<p class="t0">Here let them wed.' This ends the tale.</p>
<p class="t1">'Yes, wed at once before us;</p>
<p class="t0">And all day long throughout the vale</p>
<p class="t1">We'll sing as bridal chorus,</p>
<p class="t0">&quot;Ha--haw--haw! were got you safe at last,</p>

If I go out in the wood on the mountain<br>

All would be swallowed and nothing be quenched.<br>
Ah!--hey!--the matin bell still is a-ringing,<br>
And I'm seized with a powerful yearning already<br>
To go to the cloister, and down to the cellar!<br>
Whether I'll tarry there steadily drinking<br>
Until the night comes,<br>
Or a loud clattering thunder in heaven<br>
Breaks up this wearisome terrible heat,<br>

the Palatinate by Merian (1645), where, speaking of the village Ketsch,
he tells us that--'The Counte Palatine Otto Heinrich, afterwards
Kurfürst, sailed in the yeere 1530 to the Holie Lande and to Jerusalem.
Returning thence, hee came over the greate open sea where a shipp from
Norwaie mett him, and from it there came this crye: &quot;Flye, flye, for ye
fatt Enderle von Ketsch cometh!&quot; Now, the Counte Palatine and his
Chancellor Mückenhäuser knew a godless wretche of this name who dwelte
at Ketsch, and therefore whenn they returned home they inquired of ye
fatt Enderle and of the tyme of his deathe, and observed that itt
agreed withe the tyme whenn they did heare the crye upon ye sea, as
Weyland, a Professor of Heidelberg; hath narrated in divers wrytings

<p class="t0">In Beerbach by the Town Hall brought</p>

<p class="t1">'Bring up your sour tipple!</p>

<p class="t1">The merry riders found them,</p>

<p class="t0">A jack-boot made of porcelain</p>

<p class="t0">In the castle-court another swarm</p>
<p class="t1">Came with loud musket-banging,</p>
<p class="t0">While on the castle-master's arm</p>
<p class="t1">The second boot was hanging.</p>
<p class="t0">With their finest wine they filled the boot,</p>

<p class="t2">Holliro! the boot-cup</p>
<p class="t2">Goes round, goes round!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The Rodenstein drank out the cup;</p>
<p class="t1">'God bless your nose for ever,</p>

<br>
<p class="t0">Next morning lay a mantle white</p>
<p class="t1">Of fog o'er hill and valley;</p>
<p class="t0">They brought the album to the knight,</p>
<p class="t1">And in't he wrote this sally</p>
<p class="t0">With trembling hand--' Be this in sign</p>
<p class="t1">I folded here my banners,</p>
<p class="t0">And praise the House of Frankenstein,</p>
<p class="t1">As one of taste and manners.</p>
<p class="t0">Their welcome cheered my heart and head</p>

<p class="t0">All men are barbarous, 'tis true.</p>

<p class="t0">I a good goose they have also caught,</p>
<p class="t0">Feathered and unto the table brought.</p>
<p class="t2">To King Gambrinus</p>
<p class="t2">Once spake Saint Martinus:</p>
<p class="t0">'This world, my lord, is nothing here,</p>
<p class="t0">But a priest's slice is good with wine or beer.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The 'leventh November was the day</p>

<p class="t2">'Therefore it is our use</p>
<p class="t2">To roast the Martin's Goose.'</p>
<p class="t0">I, poor bird, that is my reward,</p>
<p class="t0">And they eat me by a subscription card.</p>

<p class="t0">How different it was upon the heather,</p>
<p class="t0">When as gosling I stood for hours together,</p>
<p class="t2">On one foot resting,</p>
<p class="t2">My bill and eye twisting</p>
<p class="t0">Unto my true love, so handsome and fine,</p>
<p class="t0">Who had flown as a gander, of age, o'er the Rhine.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Oh, would that I ne'er in town had been,</p>
<p class="t0">Where never a cook of refinement is seen!</p>
<p class="t2">She laughed at me so rudely,</p>
<p class="t2">And pinched my legs so lewdly,</p>
<p class="t0">And said, 'Though you feel as if squeezed and jammed,</p>
<p class="t0">With Indian corn your crop must be crammed.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">So even while breathing and heaving sighs,</p>
<p class="t0">I am destined for roasts or Strasburg pies.</p>
<p class="t2">My mind is lost for ever,</p>
<p class="t2">I only grow in the liver;</p>
<p class="t0">They never ask, 'Is she gentle and fair?'</p>
<p class="t0">They only ask, 'What weight will she bear?</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Is that our reward, because well behaved?</p>
<p class="t0">The world's capital one night we saved.</p>
<p class="t2">For, as they had been drinking,</p>
<p class="t2">All were asleep, unthinking;</p>
<p class="t0">Had it not been for our clatter and clack,</p>
<p class="t0">Rome had been French--yes, in Anno Tubak.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Save your scorn, gentlemen--take our advice,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall not save civilization twice;</p>
<p class="t2">And if to the Capitol,</p>
<p class="t2">Storm Claret, Hock, and Bowl,</p>
<p class="t0">No goose again will warn you from surprise,</p>

<br>
<p class="t0">In a tavern, in cool, pleasant weather--</p>
<p class="t1">I know not the name or the sign--</p>
<p class="t0">Three travellers were drinking together</p>
<p class="t1">The noblest Palatinate wine.</p>
<p class="t0">In grand ruddy Römers was blinking</p>
<p class="t1">The fine pearling Rieslinger gold,</p>
<p class="t0">And vines on the trellis were winking</p>
<p class="t1">In moonlight from grape-eyes untold.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The first, a far-travelled and wary</p>
<p class="t1">Philologist, spoke out his mind:</p>
<p class="t0">'This was made by the fire-sprite and fairy,</p>
<p class="t1">With ether and sunshine combined.</p>
<p class="t0">So it glows and it flows ever finer;</p>
<p class="t1">Spirit-sparkling, soft-rythmic we mix;</p>
<p class="t0">Like Ionian drink-songs in minor,</p>
<p class="t1">When sung by Homerical bricks'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The second, a dried-up old fellow,</p>
<p class="t1">Who the law of the Romans professed,</p>
<p class="t0">'Proficiat,' said he, ''tis mellow.</p>
<p class="t1">'What we sip is not far from the best.</p>
<p class="t0">Who sees not when Bacchus's donum</p>
<p class="t1">In this glass gleams like gold i' the sun,</p>
<p class="t0">That the Justum, æquum et bonum,</p>
<p class="t1">In this Roman are blended in one.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The third one, while trimming the tapers,</p>
<p class="t1">Said modestly, next: 'Do ye see</p>
<p class="t0">I'm no poet, and none of the papers</p>
<p class="t1">Get writin's from fellows like me.</p>
<p class="t0">But I tell you, my heart rattles quicker,</p>
<p class="t1">When such wine as I've got here I swills;</p>
<p class="t0">It's an out-and-out beautiful liquor,--</p>
<p class="t1">God bless them Palatinate hills!'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Meanwhile, with a spear on his shoulder,</p>
<p class="t1">By the bridge went a fourth man along;</p>
<p class="t0">And waving his weapon, the holder</p>
<p class="t1">Sang out to the night-wind his song.</p>
<p class="t0">'Ye gentlemen, hear what I'm singing:</p>
<p class="t1">The public need sleep--do you mind?</p>

'Would you were all wet-jolly, and fond of fun like me.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">But when the Tun of Heidelberg was filled with wine one year,<br>
Then all his future standpoint unto the dwarf was clear.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Farewell,' said he, 'oh, world, thou vale of miser-misery.<br>
All things men turn their hand to is <i>tout égal</i> to me.</p>

<p class="t0">'For wooden, stupid notions full many heats are broke,<br>

Will I, the tough old jester, pass all my life away.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Perkêo sought the cellar, and forth no more came he,<br>
For fifteen years deep drinking at Rhenish Malvasie.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Though all was dark around him, an inner radiance rained;<br>
And though his legs went shaking, he drank and ne'er complained.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">When first he sought the wine-vat 'twas heavy, full, and high;<br>
But in his dying moments it rang empty, dull, and dry.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">Then piously he uttered: 'Now praise the Lord at length,<br>
Who in me, a weak mannikin, has shown such wondrous strength!</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'As once in triumph David against Goliath stood,<br>
So I, the little dwarflet, the giant Thirst subdued.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Now sing a De profundis until the vault groans round.<br>
The Tun is fairly done for. I fall with vict'ry crowned.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">And in the vault they laid him. Around his cellar-grave,<br>
And from the empty wine-vat, as yet damp vapours wave.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">And who, as pious pilgrim, has early sought that shrine,<br>
Woe to him! In the evening he goes howling round in wine.</p>

<br>
<p class="t0">'For a hundred leagues behind Lyóns,</p>

<p class="t1">Without friends and song and love,</p>
<p class="t0">And shaken with fever, and all burned out,</p>
<p class="t1">From the foreign realms I rove.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The priest of Assmanshausen spoke:</p>
<p class="t1">'Tis well, oh penitent soul;</p>
<p class="t0">Anoint thy lips with the purple wine</p>
<p class="t1">From this holy ancient bowl.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And by that wine three days, three nights,</p>
<p class="t1">In the deep, dark cellar abide;</p>
<p class="t0">And drinking, keep by the barrels watch,</p>
<p class="t1">Till grace in thy heart shall glide.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And then in the Crown and Anchor join</p>
<p class="t1">In spiritual exercise;</p>
<p class="t0">And not till the watchman warns you, leave</p>
<p class="t1">The club with its songs and cries.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Then Heaven will surely show thee a sign,--</p>
<p class="t1">It heeds every penitent's woes!--</p>
<p class="t0">A delicate wine-green, a carbuncle red,</p>
<p class="t1">Will colour thy forehead and nose.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And when that nose is a rubied one,</p>
<p class="t1">All care will quit thy brain;</p>
<p class="t0">And then may'st thou, oh, long-lost son,</p>
<p class="t1">Turn back to thy friends again.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'We're the same old fellows; still sing by wine</p>
<p class="t1">The songs which we sang from dark;</p>
<p class="t0">Of the Sparrow and the Goldfinch fine,</p>
<p class="t1">And the summer-heralding Lark.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'We're the same old fellows, we love thee well,</p>
<p class="t1">Be thy heart from fretting free;</p>
<p class="t0">And hadst thou gone loafing yet further afar,</p>
<p class="t1">Still a calf we would slay for thee.'</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">The pilgrim sighed with tearful eye--</p>
<p class="t1">'Oh, priest, such a soothing word</p>
<p class="t0">As you have spoken, pious man,</p>
<p class="t1">In my travels I never heard.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'And now I strike my barren staff</p>

<p class="t1">May roof me a home and hearth.</p>
<br>
<p class="t0">'Flow on, thou Rhine vine-cluster blood.</p>

<p class="t0">In thy youth-giving fire-blood</p>
<p class="t1">I will bathe me to health again.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
